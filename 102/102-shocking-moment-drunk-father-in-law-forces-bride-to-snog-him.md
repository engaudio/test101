法制晚报记者从婚礼主持人处证实，该事件发生在2月22日，农历正月初七。当天，台上男子的儿子在江苏盐城某国际酒店举行婚礼。据多名盐城当地人介绍，在当地结婚现场，确有闹喜公公和新儿媳的惯例。比如，让喜公公扛个钉耙，用绳子拉着媳妇绕场一圈，但绝大多数家庭会提前商量。闹的时候大家也都知道分寸，适可而止。事发后，男方亲属回应质疑称，视频拍摄者本就是家中亲朋好友，被人恶意传播。被误传后已严重影响家人生活，新郎父亲醒酒后已经表示后悔，希望网民至此为止。

【公公强吻儿媳后续：两家人现场斗殴，公公跳楼？谣言！】近日网传消息称，江苏盐城一公公醉酒后，在婚宴现场当众强吻儿媳，引发网友关注。随后有网民发布视频称，事件发生后，两家人现场斗殴、公公跳楼自杀经核实，网传斗殴视频系2月15日江苏淮安的一起打架警情，与本次事件无关。此外，盐城警方也未接到有人跳楼警情小苏提醒，现代婚礼应营造“健康文明”的良好风尚，风俗习惯不应成为侮辱他人、伤害他人的借口，对于涉嫌违法犯罪的，公安机关将依法处理！同时，也请广大网民停止传播相关图片视频，避免对当事人造成持续困扰。

Shocking footage shows the drunk man pulling his son's bride towards him for a snog as horrified wedding guests looked on.

Shocking moment drunk father-in-law forces bride to SNOG him, sparking brawl among wedding guests. The family later released a statement saying the father-in-law was given too much to drink on his son's big day and "deeply regrets his actions"

A mass brawl broke out at a wedding after the bride's drunk father-in-law forced her to SNOG him on stage in front of hundreds of people.

Members of both families erupted into violence in the middle of the lavish ceremony in the city of Yancheng in eastern China's Jiangsu province.

The wedding appeared to be going well until the blushing bride stepped onto the stage with her new father-in-law in front of hundreds of guests.
She looked uncomfortable as the older man put his arm around her but worse was to come as he really gave her something to blush about.

Smartphone footage shows the man suddenly step in front of his daughter-in-law, take her in his arms and lock his lips on hers for a passionate embrace as she tries to break free.

The wedding DJ can be heard shouting out in surprise while howls of outrage can be heard from some guests while others clap and cheer.

Another video shows the aftermath of the man's behaviour as members of the bride's family rush the stage and attack the groom's father, knocking over some of the wedding decorations.

And the violence spilled into the foyer as members of both families became involved in a mass brawl while woman can be heard crying and shouting in the background.

The footage quickly proved popular on social media and video-sharing platforms which prompted the families to come together to release a joint plea.

They said: "We didn't expect the incident to take such a negative turn. The two families are now in an awkward position and the newlyweds have suffered because of it too.

"The father-in-law, who was given too much to drink on his son's big day, deeply regrets his actions. We ask social media users to stop sharing the videos and let our family sort this out privately.

"We do not wish to become famous, nor do we want to become the butt of every person's joke. Had this happened in your family, would you be sharing it like this?"
